That it's one of the best ways to learn a technology you haven't worked with before.

I just published an npm package/tool that allows you to create static candlestick charts for financial data. All you have to do is plug in some JSON data, set some options and call the `draw()` function on it. Check it out here for more details, there's a nice and clean little README involved: [NPM - candlestickcharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/candlestickcharts)

In a matter of a week's worth of solid work, I managed to:

- Learn how to create an NPM package (after publishing it, this point feels like a cop out since it REALLY is not that difficult. The point is, sometimes we hesitate making progress because of the anticipated workload).
- Learn how to work with HTML Canvas. I've never touched this before, but in evaluating my options for this project, I felt like this may be the best way to go about it. "Pfft...it's just HTML, right?!" Wrong. The HTML part of it all was half a line's worth of code. The rest was manipulating pixels using JavaScript.
- How to accurately scale and plot a chart using HTML Canvas, from data provided in JSON.

Let's not underestimate the value of getting practice in your favorite JavaScript ES6, object, array and Math/Number methods. Plus the fact that you just created a tool that can potentially make at least one developer's life easier and actually pushed it out into the world. That's always a good feeling. Whether or not someone takes this project and creates something out of it, well...ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

Now to find out how much maintenance work is involved, maybe I'll make another post then üòâ. In the mean time, I'm probably going to look into a new project - because let's face it, it's more fun to work on shiny new ideas than maintaining old ones. (Ha.)
